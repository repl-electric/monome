# Monome

Stolen from https://github.com/meta-ex/ignite. This is purely for my own use, watch @overtone + @meta-ex + @samaaron for the proper extraction of this lib.

Monome-serial is taken from my own locally installed snapshot: https://github.com/josephwilk/monome-serial/tree/protocols

This adds support for multiple Monome protocols.
